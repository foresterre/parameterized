/// Attribute macro's such as 'parameterized' do not enable the run tests intent for a module

/// To enable the intent within a module, we need at least a single test marked with `#[test]`.
/// The `ide!()` macro is a work around for this issue and creates this empty test. It can be called
/// within every module where we wish to run test cases using the run configuration / run test context
/// menu.

/// Using the intellij-rust new macro expansion engine, if this macro is called within a module,
/// the module will be marked as test, and the 'run as test' context menu will be provided in the
/// gutter.
